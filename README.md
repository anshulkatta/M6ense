Marvin Framework
 

Marvin is an extensible, cross-platform and open source image processing framework developed in Java. The framework provides features to:
manipulate images;
manipulate captured video frames;
multithreading image processing;
integrate plug-ins with Graphical User Interface(GUI);
analyze plug-in performance;
extend features via plug-ins;
unit test automation;

We want users to use Junit for Unit testing  !
